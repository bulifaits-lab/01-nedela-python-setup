# Python Setup Learning Project

## Project Overview
This is a beginner-level Python learning project focused on getting started with Python basics and VS Code integration. The project contains simple Python scripts for learning fundamental concepts.

## Project Structure
- **`hello.py`** - Entry point containing basic print statement examples for learning output and code execution fundamentals

## Development Workflows

### Running Code
Execute the Python script directly using Python interpreter:
```bash
python hello.py
```

### Code Execution
All code in this project is intended to be run as simple scripts. Use standard Python execution without complex build processes.

## Coding Patterns & Conventions

### Python Style
- Follow standard Python conventions (PEP 8)
- Keep scripts simple and focused on demonstrating core concepts
- Use descriptive print statements for output visibility

### Script Structure
Scripts in this project follow a straightforward pattern:
- Direct execution of commands (no main() function wrapper required unless functionality grows)
- Use print() for all output
- Keep scripts concise for learning purposes

## When Modifying Code
- Maintain the educational purpose - keep examples clear and simple
- Add comments if introducing new concepts
- Test script execution immediately after changes
- Preserve the existing print statements in `hello.py` unless explicitly refactoring

## Future Growth Markers
As this project expands, consider:
- Organizing scripts into subdirectories by topic (e.g., `basics/`, `exercises/`)
- Adding a `requirements.txt` if external packages are needed
- Creating a `README.md` with learning progression
